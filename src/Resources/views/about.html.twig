        <p>
            Hello! You've made it to Fred Dysart's website. I am an application developer currently living in Atlanta, GA.
        </p>
        <p>
            My programming interests mainly focus on solving real problems for real people. Whether that may be building
            a full featured CRM in PHP to allow a company to go about their day to day business, or writing a scalable
            system for monitoring thousands of different devices. I've worn many different hats in my career thus far.
        </p>
        <p>
            The site you are currently reading was designed and built by me and the source is available
            <a href="https://github.com/ftdysa/website"><i class="fa fa-github"></i> here</a>. The javascript powering
            the image layouts is called Masonry (and I can take no credit for it). You can check that out
            <a href="http://masonry.desandro.com/">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of work, my interests focus on getting outdoors and exploring the world. Just this past year my wife,
            Marilyn, and I embarked on a several month long journey throughout South East Asia. Our travels took us from
            Bangkok, Thailand, to Kampot, Cambodia, to Hanoi, Vietnam and just about every mountain, beach, and city
            between. We blogged about the majority of our trip at
            <a href="http://thedsoverseas.com" target="_blank" alt="Travel blog">thedsoverseas.com</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other than traveling, I've recently started attempting amateur (emphasis on amateur) photography which is the
            main focus of this site, to share pictures with family and friends. I shoot with a Canon Rebel SL1 and am currently
            experimenting with a few lenses.
        </p>
        <p>
            To unwind, I enjoy playing video games. These days I've been playing a lot of Counterstrike: Global Offensive
            and have also recently tried picking up Dota 2/League of Legends (I'm pretty terrible).
        </p>
        <p>
            Thanks! <br>
            - Fred Dysart
